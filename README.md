This repository contains data about declarations made by donors to Australian political parties for the 2015-16 financial year. (There are [separate datasets](http://periodicdisclosures.aec.gov.au/) containing declarations made by parties and associated entities.)

-	All people or organisations must make a declaration if they donate more than $13,000 in total to any one branch of a political party.
-	This year there were more than 3,000 donations declared.
-	This does not include donations made to associated entities, which are organisations that financially support parties.
-	The ABC categorised companies into 31 groups based on their main industry activity.
-	The resources category includes all mining companies, as well as petrochemical companies involved in gas and oil exploration.
-	Advocacy and lobbying organisations were categorised according to their industry of interest, or in the "advocacy/lobbyists" group if they were not associated with any one industry.
-	Investment vehicles were categorised as "finance/insurance" where it was possible to identify their main activity and investment companies with a major interest in a particular industry, for example, property, were categorised in the relevant industry.
-	Individuals donating under their own names were included in the "individuals" category, although some have interests in specific industries.
-	It was not possible to categorise all company donors. For some, there is little information publicly available. These are marked as 'uncategorised'.
-	It was originally scraped from the Australian Electoral Commission's website on February 1, 2017 using [a scraper](https://github.com/drzax/AEC-scraper-donations-declared-by-donors) originally written by [Nick Evershed](https://github.com/nickjevershed).
